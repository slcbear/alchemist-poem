I dreamt that we were alchemists,  
    And did ourselves amuse  
By turning ten threepenny nails  
    Into three ten-cent screws.  

We changed niobium to zinc,  
    And nickel into tin,  
And when we had enough of that,  
    We changed them back again.  

We took some tin and wrapped it up  
    In sodium and silk,  
Some manganese, the wax of bees,  
    Molybdenum and milk.  

This package then we buried,  
    And performed a secret rite  
Underneath a waning moon,  
    At a crossroads late at night.  

According to instructions  
    That we found in an old tome  
Beneath the granite mantelpiece  
    In the fireplace at home,  

<blockquote>

"A successful working will conclude  
    In the space of thirty days,  
If you bang a kettle drum and chant  
    This doleful German phrase:  

*Sind niemand unter der Sonne;*  
*Wir sind jemand hinter dem Mond.*  

And furthermore, you must appease,  
    In supplicatory tones,  
The Genius of the crossroads,  
    Using dried-up chicken bones,  

Beseeching her to grant a Boon  
    (Or else avert a Bane);  
These things must ye, beneath the Moon,  
    Do while its pallid light doth wane.  

And on a dark, subsequent night,  
    When the moon has ceased to shine,  
With Elder branches, on the ground,  
    Trace out these arcane arcs and lines:"

</blockquote>

These tasks we did resolve to do,  
    Despite our sense of terror  
That the Genius, a perfectionist,  
    Would tolerate no error.  

And at the next excursion,  
    We set at once to chanting,  
To implore aversion of our Bane  
    (Or beseech our Boons' swift granting).
