I dreamt that we were alchemists,
   And did ourselves amuse
By turning ten threepenny nails
   Into three ten-cent screws. 

We changed niobium to zinc,
   And nickel into tin,
And when we'd had enough of that,
   We changed them back again.

We took the tin and wrapped it up
   In sodium and silk,
Some manganese, the wax of bees,
   Molybdenum and milk.

This package then we buried
   Though mostly for a lark
Underneath a waning moon,
    At a crossroads after dark.
