I dreamt that we were alchemists,
   And did ourselves amuse
By turning ten threepenny nails
   Into three ten-cent screws. 

We turned niobium to zinc,
   And nickel into tin,
And when we'd had enough of that,
   We turned them back again.

We took some tin and wrapped it up
   In sodium and silk,
Some manganese, the wax of bees,
   Molybdenum and milk.

This package then we buried
   Though mostly for a lark
When the moon was just past new,
    At a crossroads after dark.
