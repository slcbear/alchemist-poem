I dream that we are alchemists,
    And do ourselves amuse
By turning ten threepenny nails
    Into three ten-cent screws. 

We change niobium to zinc,
    And nickel into tin,
And when we've had enough of that,
    We change them back again.

We take the tin and wrap it up
    In sodium and silk,
Some manganese, the wax of bees,
    Molybdenum and milk.

This package then we bury,
    And perform a secret rite
Underneath a waning moon,
     At a crossroads late at night.

According to instructions
    That we found in an old tome
Beneath the granite mantelpiece
    In the fireplace at home,

If we want the working to conclude
    In the space of thirty days,
We must bang a kettle drum each night
    And chant a Latin phrase.

And furthermore, we must beseech
    In supplicatory tones
The Genius of the crossroads
    By rattling chicken bones,

And asking her to grant us Boons
    Or else avert us Banes
All this we do beneath the moon
    While its pallid light still wanes.

Then, meeting at the crossroads
    When the moon no longer shines,
With apple branches, on the ground, 
    We trace out arcs and lines.
     
This task we do in darkness,
    Despite our sense of terror
That the Genius, a perfectionist, 
    Will tolerate no error.

And at the next crossroads excursion,
    We set at once to chanting,
To implore our Banes' aversion
    Or beseech our Boons' swift granting.
